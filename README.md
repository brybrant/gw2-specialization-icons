# GW2 Specialization Icons

Vector recreations of the Guild Wars 2 specialization icons made by Matt Bryant.

The silhouettes are faithful to the official in-game icons. I have also included some stylization options to change the appearance of the icons:

- **Outline**: Adds a black outline around the icon to increase contrast.
- **Shading**: Changes the icon from monochromatic to color gradients inspired by the official *“high res”* icons from ArenaNet.
- **Stroke**: Adds a dual stroke around the inside of the icon which mimics the appearance of the *“tango icons”* from the GW2 wiki.

You can also change the color(s) of the icons, selecting from a list of presets or defining your own color scheme by using the color pickers.

When you are finished customizing the icon appearance, you can output the icon as a png (rasterized) or svg.

Enjoy!
